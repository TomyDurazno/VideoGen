The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)
is an American mixed martial arts (MMA)
promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada,
which is owned and operated by Zuffa, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and features some of the highest-level fighters
in the sport on its roster. The UFC produces events worldwide
that showcase twelve
weight divisions (eight men's divisions and four women's divisions) and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. As of 2020, the UFC has held over 500 events. Dana White
has been UFC president since 2001. Under White's stewardship, the UFC has grown into a globally popular multi-billion-dollar
enterprise.
The first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.
The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art
in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines like Boxing
, Kickboxing
, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
, Sambo
, Wrestling
, Muay Thai
, Karate
, Taekwondo
, and Judo
In subsequent events, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.
In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was sold to a group led by Endeavor, then known as William Morris Endeavor (WME–IMG), including Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital[11] for US$4.025 billion. In 2021, Endeavor bought out Zuffa's other owners at a valuation of $1.7 billion.
Some famous fighters that competed in the UFC are Conor McGregor

, Khabib Nurmagomedov
, Jon Jones
